When playing Scrabble©, each player draws 7 letters and must find a word that scores the most points using these letters.

A player doesn't necessarily have to make a 7-letter word; the word can be shorter. The only constraint is that the word must be made using the 7 letters which the player has drawn.

For example, with the letters  etaenhs, some possible words are: ethane, hates, sane, ant.


LETTER SCORING:
In Scrabble©, each letter is weighted with a score depending on how difficult it is to place that letter in a word. You will see below a table showing the points corresponding to each letter:
 
Letters 	Points
      e, a, i, o, n, r, t, l, s, u 	   1
      d, g 	   2
      b, c, m, p 	   3
      f, h, v, w, y 	   4
      k 	   5
      j, x 	   8
      q, z 	   10

The word banjo earns 3 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 14 points.
